Third homework for Interactive Computer Graphics

I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with directory links to the GLEW, GLFW, and GLM Include PATHs and libraries. I also included glew32s.lib and glfw3.lib in the additional directories of the project's settings. This homework can be compiled via the debugger in Visual Studio 2019 - compiling should produce an orange cube which can be viewed from different angles using the WASD keys.

I greatly enjoyed completing this project. I initially had some trouble setting up the libraries and creating the different variants of lighting in the phong.frag file, but I was eventually successful.

Please let me know if you have any problems compiling or displaying any of my images.
